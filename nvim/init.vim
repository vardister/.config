" NOTES
" Although anything in ~/.config/nvim/plugin will be automatically sourced, I find it convenient to individually source config files so as to be able to easily comment out config files that are not needed while leaving them intact.

" GENERAL
source $HOME/.config/nvim/general/settings.vim
source $HOME/.config/nvim/vim-plug/plugins.vim

" APPEARANCE
source $HOME/.config/nvim/themes/gruvbox.vim
source $HOME/.config/nvim/themes/airline.vim
